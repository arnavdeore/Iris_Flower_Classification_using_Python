# <h1 align='center'>**Iris Flower Classification Project**</h1>

## **Project Description**
- This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (**setosa**, **versicolor**, **virginica**) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of supervised learning, including data visualization, model training, evaluation, and deployment. We will use 
  Scikit-learn's built-in Iris dataset.

# **Key Additions**
   1. Visualization: Helps in understanding data distribution and relationships.
   2. Logistic Regression: A linear model suitable for binary/multi-class classification.
   3. KNN: A simple yet effective algorithm for classification based on proximity.
   4. Feature Scaling: Essential for KNN to ensure fair distance calculation.
   5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Improves model performance through cross-validation.
   6. Feature Importance: Provides insights into which features drive the predictions.
   7. Evaluation Metrics: Always evaluate models with metrics beyond accuracy to ensure balanced performance.
   8. Model Deployment(optional): Prepares the project for practical usage with saved models.
