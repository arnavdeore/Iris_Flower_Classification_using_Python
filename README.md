# <h1 align='center'>**Iris Flower Classification Project**</h1>

# **Project Description**
- This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (**setosa**, **versicolor**, **virginica**) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of supervised learning, including data visualization, model training, evaluation, and deployment. We will use 
  Scikit-learn's built-in Iris dataset. This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal 
  width.

## **Dataset**
   - Source: The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset from Fisher's 1936 paper on discriminant analysis.
   - Features:
     1. Sepal Length (cm)
     2. Sepal Width (cm)
     3. Petal Length (cm)
     4. Petal Width (cm)

   - Target Classes:
     1. Setosa
     2. Versicolo
     3. Virginica

# **Project Structure**
   - Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset using visualizations and summary statistics.
   - Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting into training and test sets.
   - Model Training: Using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
   - Evaluation: Measuring model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


## **Dependencies**
   - The project requires the following Python libraries:

         pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### **How to Run**
   1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb).
   2. Run the cells sequentially to explore, preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.
   3. Modify the code to experiment with different models or hyperparameters.

### **Results**
  - The classification model predicts the iris species with high accuracy. Visualizations help in understanding feature importance and decision boundaries.
