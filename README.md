# <h1 align='center'>**Iris Flower Classification Project**</h1>

## **Project Description**
- This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (**setosa**, **versicolor**, **virginica**) based on their sepal and petal dimensions. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of supervised learning, including data visualization, model training, evaluation, and deployment. We will use 
  Scikit-learn's built-in Iris dataset.
